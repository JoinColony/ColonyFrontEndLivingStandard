# The Colony Front-End Living Standard

### A set of principles and guidelines to ensure we correctly balance speed, consistency and code quality when developing for the Colony front-end.

These docs are a collective effort to document the current state of best practices when developing at Colony. The intention is that they serve as a reference for old and new Colony developers alike, so that we all uphold the same set of standards and best practices as we develop at Colony. We think this will make development easier for us as individuals, as well as improve the velocity and quality of our collective output.

If you think these could be improved, please submit a pull request to the repo, or open an issue if you'd like to start a discussion.

This guide is not intended to be exhaustive. The expectation is that you independently familiarize yourself with the concepts and technologies referenced herein as much as possible. For further information, or to clarify specific cases not covered here, it's best to either infer best practice from recently submitted code, or speak to one of the team.

Happy developing!
